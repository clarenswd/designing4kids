A draft for a website aimed for kids 6-9 years old. 
This was one of my last assignments at university. I had to design a website primarily aimed to kids, 6-9 years old. I did some research, looked at some of the TV shows websites like PEPPA, Spongebob squarepants and others.  It was really challenging, balancing colours for kids is not an easy task, I wanted to mix some cool palettes and at the same time try to engage with the end users.
